## Configuration Caveats

Configuration is applied to channels on a per-location basis. 

- publishing to same channel from differently configured publisher locations

## Channel IDs

- high-entropy channel ids
- different location configurations
- multi-channel use cases

## Securing Channels

- `nchan_subscribe_existing_channels_only`
- `nchan_authorize_request`
- Using `X-Accel-Redirect`

## Websocket

- unsupported features

## Using Redis

- benefits
- drawbacks
- horizontal scaling across many nginx instances
- future cluster support
